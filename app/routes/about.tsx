          I'm a full-stack software engineer, and over the past few years I've
          worked in a variety of different fields, from commerical real estate
          to accounting, and have helped build digital products for a variety of
          different firms such as Savills, KPMG, and NYU.

          I originally grew up in the suburbs of New York, and I currently live
          in the East Village. I spent three years completing my undergraduate
          degree at Boston College, where I studied finance and information
          systems, and I recently received my master's degree in computer
          science from New York University.

          On this site, I write about technology that I'm learning about or just
          find interesting. Aside from tinkering with computers, I love soccer,
          hiking, reading, and traveling (which I hope to be able to do again
          soon ðŸ¥²).
