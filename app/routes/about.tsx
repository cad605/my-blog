            Im a full-stack web developer, and over the past few years I've
            worked in a variety of different fields, from commerical real estate
            to accounting, and for a variety of different firms such as Savills,
            KPMG, and NYU.

            I originally grew up in the suburbs of New York, and I currently
            live in the East Village. I did my undergraduate degree at Boston
            College, where I studied finance and information systems, and
            recently completed my master's degree in computer science from New
            York University.

            I try to make a lot of stuff, some of which doesn't work, but along
            the way I find I learn some new things. Aside from tinkering with
            the web, more of which can be found on my blog, I love soccer,
            hiking, reading, and traveling (hope to get back to this soon ðŸ¥²).
